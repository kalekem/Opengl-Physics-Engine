## OpenGL Physics Engine

### Description

  This code is a physics engine written in C++, which handels gravity, terminal velocity, collision between a plane and a sphere, kinematic physics and projectile motion. It is written to work with OpenGL and GL Utility Toolkit. There are two simulations prebuilt in the src folder. One, flat.cpp, is a ball bouncing on a flat plane, and the other, slope.cpp, is a ball bouncing down a slope.
